# Simulate the probabilities of X-consecutive successes in n-trials with k-"lives" feature

Simulation of Bernoulli trials.

This code simulates the probabilities of consecutive successes in binomial trial.
The feature of "lives" is added that "helps" the consecutive successes not to break (without counting lives as successes).


User has to define the following parameters in the code:
 - Sample size (t)
 - Probability of success (p) of every trial
 - Number of total trials
 - Number up to which we want to simulate consecutive successes (successes_up_to)
 - Number of available Lives (lives)
